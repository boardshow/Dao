## Work Regulation for EOSC Mainnet Secretariat
### 1.Introduction
Since June 22, 2018, the Secretariat has started exploring the decentralized community governance upon launch. As the first distributed autonomous organization, the Secretariat of EOSC Mainnet BP Meeting has experienced 5 terms. During the 5 terms, we have not only continuously promoted the construction of the mainnet based on community proposals, but also improved the governance mechanism of the Secretariat itself. We believe that the development of the community lies in both the continuous improvement and open source of codes, and the continuous improvement of the community governance mechanism.

Based on the above cognition, we edited Work Regulation for EOSC Mainnet Secretariat. On the one hand, it can set a better working reference for the new secretariat. On the other hand, it can promotes the discussions on the experience of distributed organization governance with other blockchain communities.
